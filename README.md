# AppBar3000
Released under GPL 3.0 License


An AppBar that supports 3 Monitors, Adjustable Width. You can choose the side it Docks to and settings are saved in registry and settings file.
This is a work in progress and may not work correctly as I add/change/fix features.
Plan is to create an AppBar that supports 3 monitors and allows Drag-N-Drop Shortcut creation.
