# AppBar3000
Released under GPL 3.0 License

Improvements from forked project.
Shortcut delete now works.  Added CefSharp lib for working web page form.
Forms started from bar are centered on bar and have a drop down appearance -no borders

An AppBar that supports 3 Monitors, Adjustable Width. You can choose the side it Docks to and settings are saved in registry and settings file.
This is a work in progress and may not work correctly as I add/change/fix features.
Plan is to create an AppBar that supports 3 monitors and allows Drag-N-Drop Shortcut creation.

CefSharp will need to be added to this solution in vs via Nuget
